# BST260project

Please find the full static RMD of our project in the main repository, titled "BST 260 Group Project_final.Rmd"

The knitted HTML can also be found in the main respository, titled "BST 260 Group Project_final.html"

Additional files needed for the mapping portion of the analysis are found the in the main folder as well.

For the shiny app, please access the shiny folder at BST260project/shiny/ where the app2.R file holds the code for the app

Shiny app data and associated documents are found in BST260project/shiny/data/ 

The RMD and HTML files include the app2.R code but are static and therefore do not have the interactive interface of the shiny app (this is accessed in the shiny folder and on our webpage)
