# BST260project

This is the BST 260 Final Project by: Christina Fennell, Dena Javadi, Jack Cordes, Veronica Wang, and Whitney Westhoff.

Please find the full static RMD of our project in the main repository, titled "BST 260 Group Project_final.Rmd."

The knitted HTML can also be found in the main respository, titled "BST 260 Group Project_final.html."

Additional files needed for the mapping portion of the analysis are found the in the main folder.

For the Shiny app, please access the shiny folder at BST260project/shiny/ where the app2.R file holds the code for the app.

Shiny app data and associated documents are found in BST260project/shiny/data/. 

The RMD and HTML files include the "app2.R" code but this file is static and therefore does not have the interactive interface of the Shiny app (the app is accessed in the shiny folder at BST260project/shiny/ and on our webpage at https://sites.google.com/view/countydisparities/interactive).
